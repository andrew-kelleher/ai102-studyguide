So you’ve studied for the exam and want to assess your readiness?

Practice tests are a great way to assess your readiness for the actual exam. Here are some links to the most popular ones -

- Official [Microsoft AI-102 practice test](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ai-102/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=61) (50 questions, free)
- [MeasureUp AZ-102: Practice Test](https://www.measureup.com/microsoft-practice-test-ai-102-designing-and-implementing-an-azure-ai-solution.html) (148 questions, updated June ‘25)
- [Udemy AI-102 practice tests](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=AI-102&features=has_practice_test&sort=most-reviewed) **
  
** *there are lots of AI-102 exam guides and tests on Udemy. I'd recommend going for the most recent and well reviewed ones e.g. those from [Scott Duffy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai102-azure/).*

If you’re new to certification exams, Microsoft now have an [exam sandbox](https://aka.ms/examdemo). This isn't specific to the AI-102 exam but allows you to experience the look and feel of a Microsoft certification exam before you sit one for real.

!!! tip "Exam Tip"
    The exam itself is open book. During the exam you have a builtin browser that can search and access Microsoft docs content. It's not completely unrestricted but is useful for checking capabilites, limitations etc. of a specific Azure AI service
