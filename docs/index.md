# AI‑102 Study Notes – Start Here :material-robot: 

## Introduction
When I was studying for the AI-102 exam I took a *lot* of notes. I've tidied these up and added these to the **Exam topics** section, where you'll find study notes, tips etc. for each topic. It also includes links to the official Microsoft docs for more detail where needed. Where I've found a particuarly useful GitHub repo or blog post, I've included that as well.

Happy studying and good luck with the exam! :material-robot:
