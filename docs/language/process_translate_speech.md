## :material-lightbulb-on: Implement Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text Using Azure AI Speech

üìñ **Docs:** [Speech-to-text](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-to-text) | [Text-to-speech](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/text-to-speech)

**Overview**

- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** converts spoken audio to text
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** converts text to natural-sounding speech

**Key Points**

- STT supports real-time and batch transcription
- TTS supports multiple voices and languages
- Neural TTS provides high-quality, natural voices

## :material-lightbulb-on: Improve Text-to-Speech by Using Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)

üìñ **Docs:** [SSML reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup)

**Overview**

- SSML customizes speech output beyond plain text
- Features:
    - Pronunciation adjustments
    - Emphasis and prosody
    - Pauses and pacing
    - Voice selection

**Key Points**

- SSML allows fine control of synthesized speech
- Supports phoneme definitions for correct pronunciation
- Can specify speaking styles (cheerful, empathetic, etc.)

!!! example "SSML Example"
```xml
<speak version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">
  <voice name="en-US-AriaNeural">
    Hello, <break time="500ms"/> how are you today?
  </voice>
</speak>
```

## :material-lightbulb-on: Implement Custom Speech Solutions with Azure AI Speech

üìñ **Docs:** [Custom speech](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/custom-speech-overview)

**Overview**

- Custom speech improves recognition accuracy for:
    - Domain-specific vocabulary
    - Industry jargon
    - Unique accents or dialects

**Key Points**

- Requires collection of sample audio and transcripts
- Models are trained using **Custom Speech portal** or APIs
- Useful in healthcare, finance, technical industries

!!! warning "Exam Tip"
    *Custom speech* = improving accuracy for specialized vocabulary
