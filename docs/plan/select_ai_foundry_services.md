## :material-lightbulb-on: Select the Appropriate Service for a Generative AI Solution

ðŸ“– **Docs:** [Architecture Center: Choose an Azure AI services technology](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview)

**Overview**

- Generative AI solutions require **large language models (LLMs)** or other generative models (image, text, code).
- Primary service: **Azure OpenAI Service** (models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, DALLÂ·E, Whisper)
- Managed through **Azure AI Foundry hubs/projects**

**Key Points**

- Use **Azure OpenAI** for text generation, summarization, translation, code generation, chatbots
- Model catalog in Azure AI Foundry provides additional generative models (e.g., Phi, Mistral)
- Responsible AI must be applied (content filters, monitoring)

!!! tip "Exam Tip"
    If the scenario involves **text, chat, or image generation**, Azure OpenAI is the service.
